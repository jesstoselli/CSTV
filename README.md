# CSTV ðŸŽ®
 
CSTV is a Kotlin Android application built to list CS Go matches, in order to demonstrate core Android Development skills.

It makes use of the [PandaScore Api](https://pandascore.co/).
  
This app demonstrates the following views and techniques using libs:  
  
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for making API calls to an HTTP web service.  
* [Ok HTTP](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for handing network calls.
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)  which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects. 
* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/)  which handles proper image presentation. 
* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/docs/reference/koin-android/start) for dependency injection.
* [JUnit4](https://junit.org/junit4/) for unit tests.
* [Mockk](https://mockk.io/ANDROID.html) for mocking objetcs in unit testing.

It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:  
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)  
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters  
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments  
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/)
